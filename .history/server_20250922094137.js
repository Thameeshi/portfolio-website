The system integrates sensors for tracking water flow, temperature, turbidity, and tank levels, enabling continuous monitoring of both consumption and quality. Data is transmitted to the cloud via an ESP32 microcontroller and stored in a Firebase Realtime Database, allowing for remote monitoring, visualization, and analysis. The platform provides timely alerts and notifications to prevent wastage, ensure water quality, and support proactive maintenance. By combining IoT, embedded systems, and cloud technologies, the solution promotes sustainability, resource efficiency, and environmental impact reduction.",
